I'm pretty much\\noblivious to any current firmware problems, so you'll have to get it\\nfrom someone else.\\n\\nHowever, I can tell you to stay clear of any board which uses the\\nRockwell MPU (as opposed to the DPU) for an internal implementation.\\nThis is because the MPU used \\\"speed buffering\\\" instead of having a\\n16550 interface.  Without the 550 interface, the number of interrupts\\nare still the same and thus may get dropped under multitasking\\nconditions (like in windows).  As far as I know, the \\\"speed buffering\\\"\\nworks OK for external modems if a 550 is used on the internal serial\\nport board.\\n\\nHope this helps...\\nTom\\n\\n-- \\n|Tom Barrett (TDBear), Sr. Engineer|tom.barrett@amd.com|v:512-462-6856 |\\n|AMD PCD MS-520 | 5900 E.

These electric fields change with location\\nand time in a large organism.  Special photographic techniques such as applying\\nexternal fields in Kirillian photography interact with these fields or the resistances\\ncaused by these fields to make interesting pictures. Perhaps such pictures will\\nbe diagonistic of disease problems in organisms when better understood. Perhaps not.\\n\\nStudying the overall electric activity of biological systems is several hundred\\nyears old, but not a popular activity.  Perhaps, except in the case of a few\\ntissues like nerves and the electric senses of fishes, it is hard to reduce the\\ninvestigation into small pieces that can be clearly analyzed.  There are some\\nhints that manipulating electric fields is a useful therapy such as speeding\\nthe healing of broken bones, but not understood why.\\n\\nBioelectricity has a long association with mysticism. Ideas such as Frankenstein\\nreanimation go back to the most early electrical experiments on tissue such as\\nwhen Volta invented the battery.

Without the 550 interface, the number of interrupts\\nare still the same and thus may get dropped under multitasking\\nconditions (like in windows).

These electric fields change with location\\nand time in a large organism.  Special photographic techniques such as applying\\nexternal fields in Kirillian photography interact with these fields or the resistances\\ncaused by these fields to make interesting pictures. Perhaps such pictures will\\nbe diagonistic of disease problems in organisms when better understood. Perhaps not.\\n\\nStudying the overall electric activity of biological systems is several hundred\\nyears old, but not a popular activity.  Perhaps, except in the case of a few\\ntissues like nerves and the electric senses of fishes, it is hard to reduce the\\ninvestigation into small pieces that can be clearly analyzed.  There are some\\nhints that manipulating electric fields is a useful therapy such as speeding\\nthe healing of broken bones, but not understood why.\\n\\nBioelectricity has a long association with mysticism.
